## Welcome to Atmosphere: The Asynchronous WebSocket/Comet Framework
The Atmosphere Framework contains client and server side components for building Asynchronous Web Applications. The majority of [popular frameworks](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/Atmosphere-PlugIns-and-Extensions) are either supporting Atmosphere or supported natively by the framework. The Atmosphere Framework supports all major [Browsers and Servers](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/Supported-WebServers-and-Browsers)

Atmosphere transparently supports WebSockets, Server Side Events (SSE), Long-Polling, HTTP Streaming (Forever frame) and JSONP.

### This project contains the Javascript clients available for all Atmosphere's version and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). We offer a pure [Javascript Client](https://raw.github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-javascript/master/modules/javascript/src/main/webapp/javascript/atmosphere.js) and a [jQuery Plugin](https://raw.github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-javascript/master/modules/jquery/src/main/webapp/jquery/jquery.atmosphere.js)


### To bootstap the client using Maven, add the following dependency:
```xml
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.atmosphere.client</groupId>
         <artifactId>{jquery|javascript}</artifactId>
         <version>2.0.9|2.1.2</version>
      </dependency>
```

Full API documentation can be read [here](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/jQuery.atmosphere.js-atmosphere.js-API) and a lot of samples [here](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-samples)

2.0.x version has been certified to work with Atmosphere 1.0.x and 2.0.x.

2.1.x version is certified to work with Atmosphere 2.x and also work with 1.0.x, but some API has been deprecated so you may need to change your Atmosphere 1.0.x client code.
